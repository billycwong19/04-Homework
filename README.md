#### This one took me a while! Although, I came across some road blocks, like spending hours thinking how I would approach randomly placing the correct answer in the a b c or d element, and like redoing the entire .js code. Well, I still don't have the answer in a different place each time and I'm currently working on it, but I finally came to a solid finished product. Enjoy my quiz!
